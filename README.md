# ✨ Stellar-Evo - VibeCode 🌌

The website simulates and visualizes the entire lifecycle of a star—from a protostar within a primordial nebula, through its expansion into a red giant and possible supernova explosion, to its final form as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole—based on initial parameters input by the user, such as the star’s mass.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)

### 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root to enable the Gemini-powered chatbot (currently tuned for the `gemini-2.0-flash-latest` model):

```env
